# Nulltextlang Language Project

**Nulltextlang** is a minimalist constructed language (conlang) designed to simplify and express meaningless texts and conversations in a compact and logical manner.

## Features

- **Compact vocabulary**: A system of short, logical constructions replacing meaningless words and phrases.
- **Simple grammar**: Basic structures with tense markers, articles, and emotional modifiers.
- **Clear expression**: Focus on form and emotion rather than content, ideal for conveying abstract or absurd messages.

### Example Vocabulary:
- **ot** — present tense, basic neutral statement
- **at** — past tense
- **et** — future tense
- **zo** — definite article (this)
- **ta** — indefinite article (a, some)
- **-x** — irritation modifier
- **-z** — sarcasm modifier
- **-q** — question modifier
- **-!** — exclamation modifier
